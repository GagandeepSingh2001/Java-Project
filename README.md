# Java Project

## 📘 Overview

This repository contains a Java project focused on displaying a student's mark sheet based on the information entered by the user.

It then calculates the total marks, percentage, and grade, and displays the complete mark sheet in a structured format. This project serves 
as a great example of basic Java concepts like user input handling, conditional statements, and formatted output.
